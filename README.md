## Showcase

### Current

![Client clicking around](Showcase/ClientShowcase_03_03_21.gif)

Client is able to:

	- Connect to game server running
	- Reroll
	- Buy Units
	- Buy XP
	- Level up
	- Sell Units
  	- Show purchased units on a bench
	- Shows current gold
	- Shows other players connected to the server
	- Shows the current unit selected

_* Gold looks like it isn't working correctly because certain actions don't have costs associated with them for the showcase_

### Old

This section contains old showcases of the client.
