# AutoChess

This is an attempt at creating a server authoritative auto chess game.

Inspired by Dota Underlords and Teamfight Tactics.

## Client

The client is done with Unity


## Server

The server is done using a custom game engine. The networking is done using Lidgren.


## Showcase

Client is able to:
	- Connect to game server running on localhost
	- Reroll
	- Buy Units
